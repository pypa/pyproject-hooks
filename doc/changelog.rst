UNRELEASED

  This is a private API for now.

0.10
----

- Avoid shadowing imports such as ``colorlog`` in the backend, by moving the
  ``_in_process.py`` script into a separate subpackage.
- Issue warnings when using the deprecated ``pep517.build`` and
  ``pep517.check`` modules at the command line. See the `PyPA build project
  <https://github.com/pypa/build>`_ for a replacement.

0.9
---

  with a different Python interpreter.
